 AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST:

 In comparison with previous films, there is little change.  Again there is
 some hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.
 There is also suggestion of slight blunting of the costophrenic angles as on
 previous studies, however, no evidence of acute focal infiltrate.

 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Metastatic melanoma.  Decreased breath sounds in right
 lung.

 A right subclavian vascular catheter is present, terminating at the junction
 of the superior vena cava and right atrium.  The heart size is normal.  The
 aorta is slightly tortuous.  There has been interval slight elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm.  The right costophrenic sulcus is slightly blunted.  This
 appears new in the interval.  The left lung appears clear and there is no
 evidence of left pleural effusion.

 IMPRESSION:  Slight elevation of right hemidiaphragm.  In conjunction with
 mild blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus, this could potentially
 represent a subpulmonic right pleural effusion.  Correlative right lateral
 decubitus chest radiograph may be helpful to better determine the amount of
 pleural fluid that is present.

 ET tube is in standard position.  The tip is 4.1 cm above the carina.  The
 distal tip is out of view below the diaphragm.  Cardiac size is normal.  Small
 right and moderate left pleural effusions are unchanged associated with
 adjacent bibasilar opacities likely atelectasis.  Small lung nodules in the
 right lung are better seen in prior CT from [**9-26**].  There is no
 pneumothorax.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.

 INDICATION:  Increased shortness of breath, change from class III to IV with
 history of moderately severe aortic stenosis and atrial fibrillation. Left-
 sided crackles.  Scattered crackles on right side.

 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Available for comparison is a preceding similar study of
 [**2146-10-8**].  There exists a left-sided basal density obscuring the
 contour of the left diaphragm.  It also obscures major portion of the cardiac
 contour, so that precise assessment of the overall heart size is impossible.
 There is, however, no evidence of any significant pulmonary vascular
 congestion in the accessible areas.  No acute parenchymal infiltrates can be
 identified, and the right lateral and the posterior pleural sinuses remain
 free.  No pneumothorax is present.

 Comparison is made with the next previous chest examination of [**2146-10-8**], and no significant interval change can be identified.  As before, one
 observes the presence of a humerus prosthesis in the right shoulder.

 A chest CT of [**2146-10-9**] is also reviewed, as it demonstrated clearly
 the presence of a very large-sized left-sided hiatal hernia which accounts for
 the described left-sided basal density.  The chest CT ruled out any acute
 parenchymal infiltrates, but the crowded pulmonary structures surrounding the
 large hiatal hernia indicate that there exists some degree of compression
 atelectasis.  The right hemithorax shows normal pulmonary vasculature and
 absence of any parenchymal infiltrates.

 IMPRESSION:  Sizable left-sided hiatal hernia resulting in partial compression
 atelectasis of adjacent pulmonary tissue.  There is no evidence of any new
 acute parenchymal infiltrates or newly developed CHF.

    21.4 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m MDP ([**2142-7-3**]);
 HISTORY:54 YEAR OLD MAN WITH KNOWN HCC R/O PRIOR TO TRANSPLANT

 INTERPRETATION:  Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and
 posterior projections and spot view of the arms demonstrate altered
 biodistribution of the radiopharmaceutical with relative poor uptake in the
 bones and increased uptake in the kidneys. No focal areas of increased activity
 are identified to suggest metastasis.  There is diffuse, homogenous uptake
 within the soft tissues consistent with anasarca. Diminished uptake centrally in
 the abdomen may reflect ascites.

 The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer
 excretion.

 IMPRESSION:  1. No evidence of osseous metastatic disease.
 2. Findings compatible with diffuse anasarca and possible ascites as described
 above.
 3. Altered biodistribution of the radiopharmaceutical with relative poor uptake
 in the bones and increased uptake in the kidneys of unclear etiology.

 for persistent pneumonia.

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs [**2170-2-6**], [**2170-2-3**], and [**2170-2-2**].

 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 Redemonstrated is marked convexity of the aorticopulmonary window.  The aorta
 is mildly tortuous.  A PICC terminates in appropriate position near the
 cavoatrial junction.  Compared to the most recent radiograph of [**2170-2-6**], there
 has been improvement in left upper lung ill-defined opacities.  There persists
 a small ill-defined nodular opacity which projects over the anterior left
 second rib.  Focally prominent interstitial markings of the right upper lung
 have not changed.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bones are
 demineralized.  Cholecystectomy clips are present in the right upper quadrant.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improvement in left upper lung opacity seen [**2170-2-6**] with small residual
 nodular density persisting.  Findings could reflect residual infection.
 Continued surveillance is suggested to assure resolution.  Alternatively, this
 could be further evaluated on a non-emergent basis with chest CT.
 2.  Abnormal mediastinal contour with marked convexity of the aorticopulmonary
 window has not appreciably changed compared to the recent radiograph.  While
 this could represent enlargement of the pulmonary artery, underlying
 lymphadenopathy or mass is possible.  This could also be further evaluated
 with chest CT.

 PORTABLE CHEST, [**2188-3-1**].

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Infiltrate, pneumonia.

 FINDINGS:

 Comparison is made to the prior study from [**2188-2-29**].

 The endotracheal tube terminates below the thoracic inlet.  Nasogastric tube
 courses below the diaphragm, but the tip is not seen.  There is consolidation
 of the left lower lobe.  The remainder of the lungs are clear.  There is a
 small left pleural effusion.

 HISTORY:  Ascites with shortness of breath.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**2-15**], there are again extremely low
 lung volumes that may account for much of the prominence of the transverse
 diameter of the heart.  This appearance may reflect substantial ascites.
 Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels, especially on the left, suggests elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure and there is blunting of the costophrenic angle with
 left basilar opacification consistent with atelectasis and effusion.  The
 possibility of supervening pneumonia could certainly not be excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.

 HISTORY:  Followup of necrotizing fat pancreatitis status post drainage of
 pancreatic pseudocyst.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained
 following the administration of oral contrast 150 cc of Optiray.  Prior to the
 administration of IV contrast, noncontrast images of the abdomen were
 obtained.  Reconstructed images in coronal and sagittal planes obtained.

 Comparison was made to a prior study of [**2200-6-7**].

 CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  Few images through the lung bases
 demonstrate them to be clear.  There are no pleural effusions.

 The liver is unremarkable on the noncontrast images.  On the post-contrast
 images, there are peripheral areas of increased enhancement that could be
 secondary to perfusion on this phase of the study.  It is unchanged from the
 prior study of [**2200-6-7**].  There is no ascites.

 The patient is status post cholecystectomy.  There is continued prominence of
 the common bile duct, measuring up to 8-9 mm in diameter, unchanged from the
 prior study.

 The adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable.  The spleen is not enlarged.

 Previously seen collection near the pancreatic tail has decreased
 significantly in size, and now there is a small focus of air measuring 6 mm in
 diameter, and a small amount of fluid measuring 6 mm x 26 mm in this region.
 This is further decreased compared to the prior study where it measured 46 x 7
 mm on the prior study.  The collection deeper to the tail of the pancreas has
 predominantly resolved and now measures approximately 8 mm in size seen on
 series 3, image 34, compared to 13 x 10 mm on the prior study.  The small
 pocket of fluid seen near the uncinate process now measures 6 x 6 mm,
 decreased from 15 mm on the prior study.  The small cyst in the neck of the
 pancreas measures 8 x 11 mm, compared to 16 mm on the prior study.  There is a
 percutaneous drain with its tip near the pancreatic tail, and exiting through
 the lower abdominal wall.

 No significantly enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy is
 seen.  The loops of bowel are grossly normal.  There is no bowel obstruction.

 AP CHEST, 9:37 P.M. [**2-7**]

 HISTORY:  Volume overload.  Question interval change.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**1-28**] through 31:

 Previous mild pulmonary edema and vascular congestion has nearly resolved.
 Severe cardiomegaly may have worsened, and there is mediastinal venous
 distention suggesting right heart failure.

 A large band of new atelectasis crossing the right lower lung is probably
 middle lobe collapse.  Since this has not been present previously, it does not
 suggest a malignant bronchial obstruction but instead possibly mucoid
 impaction.  Followup advised.

 INDICATION:  Persistent oxygen demand in a patient with a history of pulmonary
 effusions, cirrhosis and GI bleeding.

 COMPARISON:  [**2172-6-11**].

 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged in
 severity.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Note is again made of
 multiple median sternotomy wires as well as an aortic valve prosthetic.  There
 is no pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.  There are small bilateral pleural
 effusions which are unchanged.

 Multiple round and branching hyperdense foci are seen in the lungs
 bilaterally, unchanged from the most recent comparisons, though new since [**6-9**].  Notably, the patient underwent gastric variceal sclerotherapy with
 Lipiodol on that same date and has not ingested an barium.  For that reason,
 these opacities are presumed to represent areas of embolic lipiodol within the
 pulmonary arteries.  Recommend further evaluation via CT.  This recommendation
 was discussed via telephone by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8832**] [**Name (STitle) 4320**] with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6180**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2953**] at

 COMPARISON:  [**2107-7-27**].

 SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Compared to the prior exam, there has been
 significant interval decrease in the moderate right pleural effusion.  There
 is a new moderate right-sided pneumothorax.  Volume loss in the right lower
 lung is present with marked opacity in the collapse lower lobe which is likely
 related to previously noted rounded atelectasis.  Allowing for rotated
 position of the patient, there is no mediastinal shift. Cardiac silhouette is
 stable. The left lung is clear.

 Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10293**] by phone at 11:10 a.m. on

 Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2102-2-21**].

 The ET tube tip is 5.2 cm above the carina.  The left internal jugular line
 tip is at the cavoatrial junction.  The right internal jugular line tip is at
 the cavoatrial junction/proximal right atrium, unchanged since the prior
 study.  The NG tube tip is in the stomach.

 There is interval progression of pulmonary edema, currently moderate.  There
 is no change in bilateral pleural effusions, including loculated effusion in
 the minor fissure.  The left retrocardiac consolidation is unchanged,
 consistent with a combination of atelectasis and infectious process.

 INDICATION:  IV access needed for antibiotics.

 The procedure was explained to the patient.  A timeout was performed.

 RADIOLOGIST:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 694**] [**Name (STitle) 695**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 12**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13**] performed the procedure.

 TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the patent right
 brachial vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a
 micropuncture set. Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and
 immediately after establishing intravenous accessare on file.  A peel-away
 sheath was then placed over a guide wire, and a double lumen PICC line
 measuring 27 cm in length was then placed through the peel-away sheath with
 its tip positioned in the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  Position of the
 catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film of the chest.

 The peel-away sheath and guide wire were then removed. The catheter was
 secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate
 complications.

 IMPRESSION:  Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided 5 French
 double lumen PICC line placement via the right brachial venous approach.
 Final internal length is 27 cm, with the tip positioned in upper SVC.  The

 RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:
    3.7 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m DTPA ([**2154-8-21**]);
 *****************   AMENDED REPORT   *****************

 HISTORY:  Status post liver and kidney transplant.  Evaluation of GFR with
 DTPA.

 INTERPRETATION:  Anterior and posterior flow and dynamic images were obtained
 after intravenous administration of tracer.

 Anterior blood flow images show flow to the transplant kidney in the right lower
 quadrant.  The flow is not as brisk as normal renal blood flow, but similar to
 the prior DTPA study.

 Anterior renogram images show uptake by the transplant with excretion into the
 collecting system and bladder.  The uptake, cortical transit and excretion are
 delayed compared to normal.  The kidney is less distinctly visualized and the
 background is higher than on the MAG3 study, but the findings appear consistent
 with the difference in mechanism between DTPA (GFR) and MAG3 (ERPF).

 Posterior blood flow images show flow to both native kidneys, but the flow is
 reduced compared to normal.  The flow appears to be similar to the MAG3 study
 with the exception that the first pass extraction is lower, as expected.

 Renogram images show slow uptake by the native kidneys.  There is no excretion
 into the pelvis over the 20 minutes of study.  The bladder is visualized likely
 due to function of the transplant.  The rate of uptake appears slower than with
 MAG3, but again appears to be consistent with what is expected.

 The differential function of the native kidneys obtained by analysis of tracer
 concentration in the parenchyma from 2 to 3 minutes post tracer injection shows
 the left kidney to be performing 43% of the total renal function and the right
 kidney performing 57%.

 IMPRESSION:  Overall reduced renal function with the transplant kidney appearing
 to perform the majority of the function.  Reduced uptake, transit and excretion
 on DTPA compared to MAG3 appears to relate to the mechanisms of uptake of the
 agents.

 ADDENDUM:  The native kidney function was also compared to the transplant
 kidney.  The attenuation corrected values show the percent of activity is native
 left kidney 12%, native right kidney 15%, transplant kidney 73%.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB:
 Persantine was infused intravenously for approximately 4 minutes at a  dose of
 approximately 0.142 mg/kg/min.

 HISTORY:  Pre-op assessment.  Right toe ulcer.

 INTERPRETATION:  One to three minutes after the cessation of infusion,
 MIBI was administered IV.

 Image Protocol: Gated SPECT.

 Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium.
 Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.

 Stress images show severe perfusion defects involving the apex and the anterior
 and mid portions of the inferior wall.  A moderate defect is also identified in
 the anterior septum.

 Resting perfusion images demonstrate no reversibility in the large defects
 involving the apex, anterior and mid portions of the inferior wall.  The
 moderate septal defect is predominantly fixed.

 Ejection fraction calculated from gated wall motion images obtained after
 Persantine administration shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of
 approximately 45%.  Motion is difficult to assess on the gated study with
 decrease in counts in much of the apex and inferior wall.  The apex appears to
 be akinetic.

 Compared to the prior study dated [**2100-9-1**], these fixed and predominately fixed
 defects are new.

 IMPRESSION:  1) Severe, fixed myocardial perfusion defects involving the apex,
 and the anterior and mid portions of the inferior wall.  2) A moderate,
 predominantly fixed perfusion defect in the anterior septum.  3) These fixed and
 predominantly fixed defects are new compared to the prior study.  4) EF 45%.

 IMPRESSION:  Subcutaneous edema, without focal drainable fluid collection
 identified.

 Please ensure that the patient is undergoing routine screening mammography.
 This study was performed emergently for the expressed clinical concern of
 breast abscess and does not substitute for recommended breast cancer screening
 proceudres.

 If the swelling persists, consider repeat ultrasound and mammographic
 correlation for further evaluation.

 CHEST, [**11-25**]:

 HISTORY:  Status post esophagectomy.  Chest tubes to waterseal. Please do at
 10:30 a.m.

 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable chest radiograph performed at 10:25 a.m. on
 [**11-25**] shows small bilateral pneumothoraces.  Subdiaphramatic air also
 persists in this postoperative patient, and subcutaneous emphysema is seen
 tracking into the soft tissues at the base of the neck.  Left-sided thoracic
 catheter may have been slightly pulled back compared to yesterday's study, but
 the tip and side hole both project beyond the lateral rib cage.  Chest tube on
 the right appears in unchanged position.  Nasogastric tube side hole is at the
 level of the diaphragmatic crura.  Thin plastic tubing extending from the
 right may be a drain and Penrose drains are also visualized.  Some linear
 subsegmental atelectasis is seen in the perihilar regions and at the bases
 bilaterally.

 CONCLUSION:  Small bilateral pneumothoraces with chest tubes to waterseal.

 HISTORY:  Status post MI with stent and interaortic balloon pump placement
 with staph bacteremia.  Assess for resolution of CHF, development of pneumonia
 and position of the interaortic balloon pump.

 COMPARISON:  [**2128-2-4**].

 PORTABLE AP CHEST:  The patient is slightly rotated to the left.  An ET tube
 is in satisfactory position.  The tip of a interaortic balloon pump is
 approximately 2 cm from the arch of the aorta.  There is a Swan-Ganz catheter
 entering via the right IJ. The tip appears thickened, which could be the
 result of the tip being coiled back on itself.  A repeat non-rotated chest
 film would be helpful in this regard.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged and
 there is bilateral interstitial edema, which appears to have increased
 slightly. There is also bilateral pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.

 IMPRESSION:

 1. Slight improvement in the bilateral interstitial edema.

 2. Intra-aortic balloon pump in satisfactory position.

 3. Tip of the SG catheter may be coiled on itself (versus the effect of
 rotation on the catheter appearance) and a repeat non- rotated film would be
 helpful in this regard.

 INDICATION:  Intubation.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  An endotracheal tube tip terminates
 approximately 4.6 cm from the carina.  Low lung volumes are present.  The
 cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The nasogastric tube is coiled within
 the fundus of the stomach.  The aorta is tortuous, and the mediastinum appears
 widened.  Linear opacity is seen within the right mid lung field, which could
 represent an area of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is visualized.  No displaced rib fractures are seen.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube in standard position.
 2.  Tortuous aorta with widened superior mediastinum, the latter of which may
 be due to patient's supine positioning and low inspiratory lung volumes.
 Depending on the mechanism of injury, there should be a low threshold for
 obtaining a chest CTA.

 COMPARISON:  Chest X-ray dated [**2158-5-13**].

 INTERPRETATION:  Ventilation images could not be obtained secondary to patient's
 acute shortness of breath.  Perfusion images in eight views demonstrate a small
 non-segmental perfusion defect within the patient's left upper lobe.
 Elsewhere, there is heterogeneity of perfusion.

 The chest X-ray demonstrates mild increased retrocardiac opacification.

 The above findings are consistent with a low likelihood ratio for recent

 HISTORY: 56 year old male with NIDDM status post CABG in [**2107**] referred for
 evaluation of troponin leak.

 SUMMARY OF DATA FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:

 Exercise protocol: [**Doctor First Name 84**] Treadmill
 Resting heart rate: 82
 Resting blood pressure: 150/90
 Exercise Duration: 6 min.
 Peak heart rate: 96
 Percent maximum predicted heart rate obtained: 59%
 Peak blood pressure: 160/70
 Symptoms during exercise: None.
 Reason exercise terminated: Fatigue.
 ECG findings: No ischemic changes,

 METHOD: Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi.  Tracer
 was injected approximately one hour prior to obtaining the resting images.

 At peak exercise, approximately three times the resting dose of Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi
 was administered IV.  Stress images were obtained approximately one hour
 following tracer injection.

 Imaging Protocol: Gated SPECT

 This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model.

 INTERPRETATION:

 The image quality is good.

 Left ventricular cavity size is normal.

 Resting and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout the
 left ventricular myocardium.

 Gated images reveal global hypokinesis.

 The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 36% (previously 51%).

 Compared with the study of [**2109-9-13**], there has been a significant increase in
 global left ventricular hypokinesis and LVEF.

 IMPRESSION: 1. Normal myocardial perfusion at the level of exercise achieved.

 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF [**2161-5-2**]

 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of [**2161-5-1**].

 FINDINGS:  Left chest tube remains in place with persistent moderate left
 apical hydropneumothorax.  Widespread subcutaneous emphysema has slightly
 decreased, and pneumomediastinum also appears slightly decreased in the
 interval.  Surgical chain sutures are present in the left lung consistent with
 wedge resection procedures.  Bibasilar atelectasis and small pleural effusions
 appear similar, with partial loculation laterally.  On the lateral view, a
 dependent area of opacity within the left apical hydropneumothorax is again
 demonstrated and may correspond to a suspected hematoma on prior chest CT.

 IMPRESSION:  Similar appearance of loculated left apical hydropneumothorax
 with chest tube in place, but slight decrease in subcutaneous emphysema and
 pneumomediastinum.

 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH [**2171-3-31**].

 INDICATION:  Fatigue, hemoptysis and weakness.

 Comparison is made with study of [**2171-2-16**].

 The heart size and mediastinal contours are stable.  The pulmonary vessels are
 within normal limits and there is no evidence of failure.  There is near
 complete resolution of bibasilar atelectasis that was seen on the prior study.
 A small amount of atelectasis remains at the left base.  There are no focal
 areas of consolidation. There are no effusions or pneumothoraces.  Note is
 made of a prosthetic aortic valve and sternotomy.

 IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia or failure.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  To assess for pneumothorax status post radiofrequency ablation.

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from [**2166-11-27**], and [**2166-11-26**],
 and a pre-procedural radiograph from [**2166-10-30**].

 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  No evidence of pneumothorax.  The pulmonary
 lesion in the left infrahilar region, appears similar in size compared to the
 prior study measuring 4.7 x 2.8 cm, but is slightly denser.  Size of the
 lesion has increased when compared to the pre-procedural radiograph, and is
 secondary to the recent radiofrequency ablation.  Recommended followup
 radiographs for resolution as per the protocol.  The right lung is well
 expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.

 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient after VATS.

 Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to prior study obtained the same day
 earlier at 3:07 a.m.

 There is currently improved aeration of the right hemithorax that might be due
 to decreased  pleural effusion.  The position of the two chest tubes is
 unchanged. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is relatively stable as well as
 there is no change in the left retrocardiac atelectasis and pleural effusion.
